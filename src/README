Usage :

wbemcli gc|gcd|dc|ec|ecn|gi|ci|mi|di|ei|ein|ain|ai|rin|ri|gp|sp
	        [-nl] [-dx] [-t] [-h] [-v]
	        [-ac <assocClass>] [-arc <resultClass>] [-ar <role>] [-arr <resultRole>]
	        <url> [<attrs>]
	gc	get class
	gcd	get class definition
	dc	delete class
	ec	enumerate class
	ecn	enumerate class names
	ci	create instance
	mi	modify instance
	di	delete instance
	ec	enumerate instances
	ecn	enumerate instance names
	ain	associate instance names
	ai	associate instances
	rin	reference instance names
	ri	reference instances
	gp	get property
	sp	set property
	cm	call method
	cmx     call method (returns XML)

	-nl	one attribute per line
	-dx	xml debugging
	-t	add array([]) and ref(&) indications
	-h	help
	-v	version

	-ac	 association class name (ai, ain only)
	-arc	 result class name (ai, ain, rin, ri only)
	-ar	 role name (ai, ain, rin, ri only)
	-arr	 result role name (ai, ain only)

	url	'<protocol>://[user:password@]<host>[:<port>]/<namespace[/..]>:<classname>[.<key=value[,..]>]'
	attrs	'<name=value[,..]>' (required for ci and mi only)

	Single quotes should be used around the url and attrs to perserve double
	qouted strings. If not enclosed the double quotes will be striped by the
	shell, and wbemcli will mistake string values starting with a digit/+/- as
	numeric, or strings starting with 'true/false' as boolean.
		example 'http://localhost:5988/root/cimv2:rpm_package.name="glibc",id=5'

	Host indirection support: The string '<protocol>://[user:password@]<host>[:<port>]' 
	can be replaced by an arbitrary string. This string will be used to 
	locate the proper protocol and host specification in ./wbemcli.ind or 
	any file specified via the WBEMCLI_IND environment variable.
	Format in ./wbemcli.ind is:
		<string>: <protocol>://[user:password@]<host>[:<port>]

BUILD Notes:

See the INSTALL file. If checking out of CVS first run autoconfiscate.sh to
setup the autotools.

SSL Notes:

Currently SSL (https) support is only working with libcurl. wbemcli supports
both verification of the server and client certificate authentication.
For server verification it is necessary to have access to a self signed
certificate of the server or a CA certificate of the CA that issued the
server's certificate in PEM format. 
There's no default location for this certificate: it must be specified with 
the -cacert option.
The server certificate verification can be disabled with the -noverify option.
If the server requires a client certificate, it can be specified with 
-clientcert in which case it is also necessary to specify the client's
private key file with -clientkey. Both files must be in PEM format.

BUGS:

Authentication with libghttp is broken: incorrect user/password will cause a
hang situation.

Authentication with libwww is slightly broken: incorrect user/password will
cause a meaningless error code.
